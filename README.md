My personal portfolio website
I'm Harish A, a Computer Applications student at CMR University with strong knowledge in full-stack web development and database management. I recently completed a 2-month Web Development Internship at Hope Foundation, where I developed full-stack applications using Python and Flask with integrated database solutions. I hold certifications in Cloud Computing from NPTEL and successfully completed the Summer Internship Program at Hope Foundation, which have further strengthened my expertise in modern web technologies and cloud platforms. My project portfolio includes an AI-powered chatbot for enhanced communication, a 3D Solar System visualization using Three.js, and a real-time weather application. I possess strong knowledge in Python, JavaScript, C, and Java, with hands-on experience in Flask, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, AWS, MySQL, and SQLite. I'm passionate about building accessible tech solutions that make a meaningful impact and am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects.
